"""OrchestratorRunner — thin CLI adapter for the event-driven GameOrchestrator.

The CLI's runner protocol expects an object with:

- ``async run()`` that blocks until the game terminates and returns a
  result object with ``.reason`` and optional ``.winner`` attributes
- ``set_mission(mission)`` no-op method for compatibility with the
  ``SimulationRunner`` interface

:class:`GameOrchestrator` does not itself expose ``run()`` because it
lives in the event-driven world and is driven entirely by the bus —
``_on_start`` triggers the first activation, and the bus fanout drives
every subsequent move. The CLI, however, needs a blocking handle to
wait on until termination.

This wrapper is the narrow compatibility shim that lets us plug the
orchestrator into the existing CLI ``_setup_simulation`` / ``runner.run()``
flow without changing upstream code. It delegates to
:meth:`GameOrchestrator.await_result` which resolves when the
:class:`GameTerminatedEvent` is published.

Historical note: the legacy round-based ``volnix/game/runner.py`` and
the CLI's dual-runner detection were deleted in Cycle B.10. This file
is the event-driven replacement; it lives on indefinitely as the CLI
compatibility shim.
